# quiz

Hello there, welcome, so in this assignment we were supposed to make a quiz. This quiz didnt have a specific topic but we did need to do at least 5 questions. 
The criteria for this was, there has to be a timer, you need multiple choice questions, and if you get a question right or wroing it will deduct points. So far I did 
fairly, but i had an issue with trying to remove or add points upon getting the correct or wrong asnwer, any tips will be greatly appreciated.
